Danger connect 4!

Basic
2 players
Player 1 is red, player 2 is yellow
The grid is X x X big
Player 1 goes first to choose which column to drop a piece into
The piece gets dropped

Player 2 chooses which column to drop the second piece into
The piece gets dropped

This continues until one player gets X pieces in a row, in a column, row or diagonally.
When a player achieves this, the pieces will explode and the game / grid crumbles.


Potential Extras
The game will be on a timer and as the time is nearly up parts of the grid / game will start to crumble away.

Just as a player is about to get 4 in a row they'll be asked a question - if get get it wrong one of their pieces disappear.
