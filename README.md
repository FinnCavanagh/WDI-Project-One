###README

###Synopsis

The project is a classic two player 4-in-a-row game. To win the game you must get 4 in a row of the same colour, either horizontally or vertically. 


###The Technology

It was built using basic Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS and Google fonts libraries.


###Motivation

This is my first project in a Web Development Immersive course. It was a great opportunity to apply my javascript learning as well as play around with html and css.
